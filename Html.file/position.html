    <!-- static
     
      static positioned elements are not affected by the
      top, bottom, left, and right properties.
      
      An element with position: static; is not positioned in any
      special way:
      it is always positioned according to the normal flow of the page:
      
    -->

    <!-- <div style="position: static;
              margin: 5px;
              
              border: 1px solid darkcyan;">
        This is at position static.
    </div> -->

    <!--Fixed
        
       An element with position: fixed; is positioned relative to the
       viewport,
       which means it always stsys in the same place even if the page
       is scrolled.
    -->

    <!-- <div style="position: fixed;
     
               border: 1px solid darkorange;">
      this is at position fixed.         
    </div -->
    
   <!-- sticky 
     
    An element with position: sticky; is positioned base on the user's
    score position.
       A sticky element toggles between relative and fixed, depending on
       the scroll position.
   -->

   <!-- div style="position: sticky;
               top:20px;
               border: 1px solid darkcyan;">
        This is at position sticky.

    </div -->
    
    <!--
     An element with position: relative; is positioned relative to its
     normal position.
    -->

    <div style="position: relative;
         border: 1px solid darkcyan;
         background-color: rgb(83, 161, 189); 
         width: 300px;
         height: 300px;">
     This is at position Relative.
    </div>
  
    <!--Absolute
    
      An element with position: absolute;
       is positioned relative to the nearest positioned ancestor (insted of positioned
       relative the viewport, like fixed).
       if an absolute positioned element has no positioned ancestors, it uses the document
       body, and moves along with page scrolling.
    -->

      <div style="position:absolute;
       
                  border: 1px solid darkcyan;
